# Write a Python program that creates two lists,
# one containing time data (50 data points over 5 seconds) and the other
# containing the corresponding vertical position data for this projectile.
# The program should ask the user for the initial height yi and initial
# velocity vi, and should print a nicely-formatted table of the list values
# after it has calculated them.
